# week-02-assignment
I was able to create a page with a header,navbar and a footer.
I also able to fill the page with images whilest also having a scrolldown page.
I positioned the images correctly using Flexbox aswell as containers which contains text in them.
I also used different colours across the site to make it look pleasing.

I also did some strech requirements which include a hover effects on the button and navbar to make them more interactive.
I was able to create a back to top button which works quire effectively but it was quite challenging to create as you have to make functions in javascript which i am still trying to figure out.
